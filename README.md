### matkv

I am a software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally and in my free time I have been using **C#**, **Flutter/Dart** and a little bit of **Python** & **Go**. Currently my main side projects are building my [personal website](https://matkobusljeta.com), working on a [small cli program](https://github.com/matkv/lichess-stats) and learning **Rust**!
