Developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally and in my free time I have been getting into **Flutter**, **Python** and **Go**. 

At the moment my main pet project is a C#/Winforms desktop app which will help me automate the digitalization & cropping of scans of my old photos using OpenCV.
